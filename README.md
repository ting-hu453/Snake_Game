# SE3860_Fall2021 

## Description
This Snake game is recreated for the University of Wisconsin - Platteville SE3860 class. Using C# .NET Framework Development, my team used Graphics Class to draw the snake and apple while using LinkedList to make sure the snake body is following the snakehead. The purpose of this project is to understand the reengineering process and use different concepts to maintain the software while working in a small group with Scrum methodology.

The original game is created with QBasic, source code can be find from https://github.com/pcluddite/snake-basic. 

## Installation
Navigate to team01 > SnakeGame > SnakeGame > bin > Debug 

Open the SnakeGame Application (SnakeGame.exe) found in the outermost folder structure. 

Note: If the HighScores.JSON file does not already exist, the scoreboard will be initially empty.

## Game Play Instruction
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the gameplay screen. 

Use W, A, S, and D to move up, left, down, and right respectively. 

Run into “apples” to eat them, increasing the score by 5, and increase the speed of the snake. 

The speed will increase with each apple retrieval up to a certain speed limit. 

The game is over when you collide with the wall, the snake body, or the executable is closed.

When the game ends, if you have a high score, you will be prompted to enter your name.

The top 10 scores will appear on a scoreboard. 

From the scoreboard, follow the on-screen prompt to either restart the game or close the application.
